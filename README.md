                User should be able to log out and be redirected to welcome page.
                User should see instructions on home page and be able to search for venues of their preference.
                User should be displayed a results list of 9-12 different venues ordered by rating and popularity.
                User should be able to clic on any of the venues displayed and be taken to a venue-specific information page.
                User should be able to add this specific venue to their favorites or to go back to the results list.

Scope. What are you planning to build? What features will it have? What do you think you can reasonably implement in the time period?
Object Models. Draw out the model associations for your project. Pen and paper is very easy and you can take a picture to save it, or use software like PowerPoint, Keynote, Gliffy (online), and Omnigraffle ($$).
Wireframes. Recall our first day and the "about you" table drawingsâ€¦ Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and how they will work and link between each other. Again, pen and aper works great. You can also check out wireframing software like Protoshare or Balsamic.
Resources. Gather the necessary resources and bookmark links to any documentation or references you will be using in your project. Add them to your README.md in a section called "Resources."
Milestones. We will give you some dates and milestones to help keep you on track. Outline some specific milestones for yourself based on how you prefer to work, as they fit into our class milestones.
CHANGELOG.md Projects use a "Change log" to keep track of what has happened and what changes were made. Check out the pry CHANGELOG for an example. Use the milestones here to show the progress.
README.md Projects need a readme file in markdown explaining their project. Explain your concept and data model. What problem are you solving?! Add your list of resources (what gems and APIs are you using?), research, and documentation links to this file.
Planning board. We will be using Trello for this. It is simple and lightweight. Your planning board needs to show the user stories and project completion status.
